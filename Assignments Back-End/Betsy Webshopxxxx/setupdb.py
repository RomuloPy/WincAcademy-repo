Cristofori, unsatisfied by the lack of control over the volume level of the Harpsichord, replaced the plucking mechanism from the old versions with a hammer to create the modern piano. A Piano player activates these hammers by pressing keys on the Keyboard, and the harder the pressure, the louder is the volume. It belongs to both the string and the percussion family and technically is one of the most complicated musical instruments, with over 2500 parts.',

They have devices called magnetic pickups embedded into their body under the strings. When the strings vibrate, these pickups convert the vibrations into electric signals, which pass through an amplifier over a cable where they are converted into sound and played. They have a wooden body and the widest range of shapes possible, as the shape of an electric guitar doesnâ€™t affect the sound it produces.',
