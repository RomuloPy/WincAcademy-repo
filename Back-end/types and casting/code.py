'''
(Type)-casting
If you have a string with a number in it and you want to use it in a calculation,
or if you have a number and want to use it in a sentence: that's possible.
What you can do is "cast" the value to another type. In other words: casting means converting a value of one type to another type.

'I like ' + str(3.14)

# Strings

example_one = 'I am a string.'
example_two = "Me too!"
example_three = """I too am a string.
                   I am, in fact, a multiline string!"""

example_one = 'I\'m a string.'
example_two = "I'm a string."
example_three = 'He said: "I\'m a string"'

# There are more characters with special meanings:

# \n produces a new line;
# \t produces a tab.
